Chorale Generator
=================
About
-----
+ The purpose of this program is to autonomously generate 4-part music that follows classical composition rules.
+ This program generates _Alda source files_ for easier playback.
+ I also have included a folder of notes and research pertaining to this program, and will try to keep a journal of my process (because this is also an English assignment).

Installation
------------
+ Don't try to install it, yet.
