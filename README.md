Chorale Generator
=================
About
-----
+ The purpose of this program is to autonomously generate 4-part music that follows classical composition rules.
+ This program generates _Alda source files_ for easier playback.
+ I also have included a folder of notes and research pertaining to this program, and will try to keep a journal of my process (because this is also an English assignment).

Installation
------------
+ A working version of Alda is needed. The GitHub project can be found here: https://github.com/alda-lang/alda#installation
+ You'll also need python3.
+ An introduction to the Alda language can be found here: http://daveyarwood.github.io/alda/2015/09/05/alda-a-manifesto-and-gentle-introduction/
